## BACKEND:

### MongoDB 
- Can you propose a NoSQL or MongoDB schema that a social media platform may use to perform these functions: 
    1) Register user details 
    2) Send/Receive and Accept/Reject friend request from users 
    3) Create text-only posts and comments on their friend's posts. 
 
### Javascript
- If you have to create an Insta or FB like content feed for users, then what sort of operations (or APIs) will be needed?
- The Insta/FB feed must fulfil below requirements:
  1) 	A user can see only those posts which were created by their friends
  2)	A user can see posts of people who are not their friends, only if a friend has posted a comment on it
